Website built with Bootstrap. 

First I found it very difficult to work with bootstrap as you dont have as much freedom to customize everything like when using pure html and css. 
I know I should have been able to connecting scss file and connect it with bootstrap to create variables and @mixin / @import but I had trouble with it (had trouble with my terminal)

Using sass would have made everything way easier to customize color, fonts, margin etc but instead I added the styles in the html file (yes I know, it looks a bit messy and a lot of things within the style)

But after a while I started enjoying bootstrap, for example how easy it is to create responsive website (and that responsive menu took no time!üòç)

The only active link are the buttons "view more" and "schedule" in the menu. I created 2 pages, front page and schedule page. 

In this website I used: 

Front page.
    Text area and carasoul in the first section, I divided it in equal columns and made them stack on each other when the screen get smaller. 
    On the front page I used cards as well and buttons (but customized the color)

Scheduel page. 
    Buttons to switch between days (not active) and table as a time table for the festival. Below that are other cards with buttons inside.
